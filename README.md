# ImageInsight
A cloud-based web application to extract text and labels from images. Users can upload images through the site and choose how they want the information extracted. The application uses Amazon Textract to get text from the images and Amazon Rekognition to identify labels.
Once processed, the extracted data is shown to the user, making it easy to get useful information from the images. This application is useful for tasks like digitizing documents and analysing content.
